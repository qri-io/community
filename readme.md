## Discord Chat
Your first stop if you have questions that you can't answer with our [website](https://qri.io) or [github](https://github.com/qri-io) is to check our discord chat:

#### [Join Discord Chat](https://discordapp.com/invite/etap8Gb)

All of the core Qri team and many members of the Qri community hang out here. Feel free to pop in, say hello, and ask questions!

## Community Calls
We host one call each week that's open to the public. The purpose of the call alternates weeks, but we try to keep the time slot the same for the sake of consistency. **Calls are recorded** & uploaded to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7E3_hURgFO2mVCLDwPSyOQ). The "source of truth" for our calls is this calendar:

### Using Qri Call
Weâ€™re hoping these will serve as an opportunity for us to connect with Qri peers, share news, walk through our roadmap, surface bugs, UI/UX ideas, answer questions, and learn how we can be more supportive of data projects in general.

### Building Qri Call
In other projects this would be called the "developer call". Here we take time to coordinate on technical projects around building Qri itself. You don't need to be actively developing Qri, or even a software developer to join this call.

### Quarterly Calls
Once a Quarter we have a call to check in on the progress of the project against long term goals, and define goals for the next three months. This is a great chance to hear about where the project is headed at the marco level, and goals we've achieved to date. If you only have time to join one Qri call, join this call.

## Participating
We have guidelines for working as an open project, these are all contained in this repo. We take our code of conduct seriously, and work to create an open, inclusive space for constructive collaboration.
